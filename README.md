## **Get Your peerPubKey**
6.`Inspect Element` into your extension and go to the `Console` tab.

7. Extract ```peerPubKey``` 
  ```javascript
  chrome.storage.local.get("nodeData", function(data) {
    console.log("Node Data:", data.nodeData);
});
```
This will print something like:
```javascript
{
  "peerEncryptedPrivKey": "m9+YyMXk7N1daxSR...",
  "peerPubKey": "12D..................................k"
}
```

## **Multiple Nodes**
1. You can remove the extension after obtaining its ```peerPubKey``` and download it again to get a new one.
2. Repeat this process as many times as you like.
3. There is a cap of 5 devices so no need to go all out.
> **SECRET INFO**:
> The 5 `PubKeys` you extract from one account, can be used with other accounts.
> 
> Remove your extension then create a new account with your refferal code and extract the `B7S_AUTH_TOKEN`.
> 
> Add the `B7S_AUTH_TOKEN` to the `usertoken` field in the ``data.py`` and copy paste the ``PubKeys`` from before and run the script.
